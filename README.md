The major dataset used for this analysis is a Retail Sales Data. The key methodology used is Microsoft Excel and the Pivot table in Microsoft Excel was the major tool used to address and answer all of the project questions.

Post-Analysis Observation and Recommendations:

Observations;

1. Customer Adavan who topped the other customers is from Bodi city in the Western region . The customer purchased more goods from the store during the fourth quarter of the four years. The sub-categories he purchased more were health drinks, organic vegetables, chocolates, and soft drinks with a discount of 52.16% in all.

2. A total of $503 sales was made in the Western and Southern region from 2015 to 2018. The sub-categories that sold more within these regions were fresh fruits, soft drinks, and chocolates. Madurai, Perambalur, and Viluppuram cities generated most of these sales. The customers for the generation of this sales were customer Muneer, Shah, and Roshan

3. The central region generated $3,468,158 profit for the store throughout the four quarters. They sold more Noodles, Health drinks, Soft drinks, and Chocolates. The major customer for this region is customer Vidya with a discount rate of 14% for all purchases and their major cities of sale are Vellore and Bodi city.

4. The sub-category bread and buns did not sell much in the first and second quarter of the four years despite the low discounts of 3.45% and 3.38% respectively given to the main customers of this sub-category. The sub-category was sold in all the regions but was mostly purchased by customers Amrish and Arutra from Perambalur and Bodi City .

Post-Analysis Recommendation:

1. I recommend that a questionnaire should be issued out to all customers of the store in different regions to ascertain their views and complaints about the Grocery store. And corrective and more strategic measures should be taken to get more of their patronage and meet customer satisfaction, so that customer Adavan wouldn’t be the only top and outstanding customer in the following years.

2. A studying and understanding of what sub-category the Southern and Western regions prefer more or would like to purchase should be carried out and the store can make sure those sub-categories are within their reach and at affordable prices.

3. More intense advertising and awareness of the Grocery store and the affordable product categories and sub-categories it offers should be made at the central region to enable higher profit generation from this region.

4. I recommend that the quality of the sub-category bread and buns be upgraded and bonuses and sales benefits should be placed on them in all regions so it generates more sales and profits.

Conclusion:

The Retail Analytics For Supermart Stores for 2015 to 2018 shows the retail of product categories and sub-categories for these four years. A list of their customers, the prices for each category was analyzed, the discount given to each customer and the profits made from them were ascertained.
